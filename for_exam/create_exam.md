  Q1: When should we have CensusEngine UND Matching Engine on the FPGA? And when should we have Census Engine ODER Matching Engine? Please explain that with the figures of different conditions. 

  P1: What are purposes of 1. CensusTransformation 2. Matching Engine 3. on Chip Bus(PLB)?
   
    CensusTransformation is a process that is used to collect and organize data about the state of a chip. This data can be used to track the performance of the chip, identify potential problems, and make changes to the chip's design.
    
    Matching Engine is a component that is used to compare two or more sets of data. This can be used to find similarities between the data sets, identify differences, and perform other operations on the data.
    
    on-chip bus (PLB) is a high-speed communication channel that is used to connect different components on a chip. This allows the components to share data and communicate with each other.


  P2: What are differences between Census Transformation and Census Engine? Example?

  P3: What are
