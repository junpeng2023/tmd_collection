## About the labels

Do not delete labels or try to make the bounding boxes disappear, otherwise there would be problems when generating json files.

The modification after a new label appended might be invalid, then we will have to do annotations from the beginning.

The number of objects in CVAT must fit the number in the dataframe, otherwise Traceback.
