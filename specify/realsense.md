# Depth Quality Tool
 Q: How to confirm the successful calibration?
 A: Three metrics: 1. Fill Rate>=99%
                   2. plane RMS Error <=2%

 Q: How to check the metrics?
 A: Put the camera towards a plane wall or just the ground without your feet to check the metrics, anyways the surface should be plane otherwise fill rate too low and RMS Error too high
